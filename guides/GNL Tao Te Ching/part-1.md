# Part 1

## 一 The Way

The Way that can be experienced is not true;
The world that can be constructed is not true.
The Way manifests all that happens and may happen;
The world represents all that exists and may exist.

> To experience without intention is to sense the world;
> To experience with intention is to anticipate the world.
> These two experiences are indistinguishable;
> Their construction differs but their effect is the same.

Beyond the gate of experience flows the Way,
Which is ever greater and more subtle than the world.

## 二 Abstraction

When beauty is abstracted
Then ugliness has been implied;
When good is abstracted
Then evil has been implied.

```text
So alive and dead are abstracted from nature,
Difficult and easy abstracted from progress,
Long and short abstracted from contrast,
High and low abstracted from depth,
Song and speech abstracted from melody,
After and before abstracted from sequence.
```

The sage experiences without abstraction,
And accomplishes without action;
He accepts the ebb and flow of things,
Nurtures them, but does not own them,
And lives, but does not dwell.

## 三 Without Action

```html
<p>
  Not praising the worthy prevents contention,<br>
  Not esteeming the valuable prevents theft,<br>
  Not displaying the beautiful prevents desire.
</p>
```

In this manner the sage governs people:
Emptying their minds,
Filling their bellies,
Weakening their ambitions,
And strengthening their bones.

```javascript
function (people = {}, action) {
  const values = Object.keys(people);
  if (!value.includes('knowledge') && !value.includes('desire')) {
    people.canAct = false;
  }
  
  if(!action) {
    Harmony = true;
  }
```
